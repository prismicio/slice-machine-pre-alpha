# Slice Machine Draft README

A library of reusable, high-quality website sections to be used in your own Nuxt project - with and without Prismic.

Make sure to view the complete list of components [here](https://prismic.io),

⭐️Oh and star us on GitHub — it helps!

### Motivation
Developing websites sometimes feels tedious and redundant. In addition to choosing a framework and build tools, you'll need to design the same components over again and find a way to feed them with content.

We believe that Nuxt has already made the process of creating modern websites a lot faster and that VueSlices

Vue-slices is a project that aims at helping both developers and designers make websites 10x faster.

What was the motivation for this project being built in the first place?
What types of projects would this project be a good fit for, and when might something else be better?

### Getting started

First iteration is pretty simple: copy-paste what you like and start using the components.

#### 👇 For Prismic users
If you're already used to building websites with Prismic, think of this library as a solution to kickstart your project or custom type in a matter of minutes. We offer you both the code and the model you need to create the slice in the writing room.

1. Select the slice components you want to use
2. Copy paste their respective `model.json` in the writing room
3. Add the slices folder to your projects
4. Import the slices in your ``
